# DLStorkFeedingBehaviour

Desert locust plagues are still a threat to vegetation and agricultural lands in Africa and Asia as the recent outbreak in East Africa demonstrates. 
This is because it is a complex task to predict when and where desert locust will start breeding as this depends on several environmental conditions.

Previous work covered the creation of machine learning models which identify a potential risk area based on environmental data and the presence of white storks 
potentially feeding on desert locusts. To harden the evidence that the identified area is a desert locust breeding area a model should be build which can be 
used to identify "feeding on desert locusts" behavior of white storks based on acceleration data.
